# Circles

**Click on any letter on your Keyboard to generate a circle and to trigger a sound**

This experiment is based on [Patatap](https://patatap.com/).

I re-created a clone but working only with circles.

For this project I used **Javascript** and the libraries [PaperJS](http://paperjs.org) and [HowlerJS](https://howlerjs.com/).
